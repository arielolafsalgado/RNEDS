# RNEDS
Public dataset for the R Network Evolution Analysis

This repository holds two datasets obtained through scrapping of the Comprehensive R Archive Network [CRAN](cran.r-project.org/). It includes information from the _Archived_ and _Active_ packages at December 2020. The datasets provide essentially the same information, but in different formats. The `eventList.csv` file provides a list of _events_ which are package / relations creation and deletion. The `fullNet2.RData` file provides a network generator `G` as an [igraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html) object. The `eventList` file includes the relations (**Suggest**, **Depends**,**Imports**) created and deleted, and whether their creation was _Internal_ (the link connects preexisting packages) or _External_ (the link connects at least one freshly added package). The network generator `G` contains all the links created at some time, the relationship type (`type` attribute) and the lapse in which they where present (`lifespan` attribute). For further questions feel free to contact the repository maintainer.
